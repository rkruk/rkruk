### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafal and most of the time I am a web developer.<br><br>
I have more than a few years of Linux sys administration knowledge and experience(~ish), but that doesn't make me an expert in all Linux things.<br>
For a living I do IT Consultancy to those in the need of help with anything web related but what I do like is ðŸ˜„ fixing broken websites and build the new ones.<br><br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I always solve problems when I stumble on them, and soon after I forget how I did THAT fix (yeah.. I usually try to write it down somewhere). That created a need to write things, which pushed me work harder to write it without any terryfying eye soaring mistakes... And that accidently created idea of writing just for myself. So yeah I write now things for myself. Like a 'story' story things with the plot and some plot twists ðŸ˜„.
