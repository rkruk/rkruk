Hi!
<br>
My name is Rafal and I am a web administrator.
<br><br>
For a living, I do a various of things for a really cool company - mostly Web Administration and IT Support.
<br>
I like to tinker with Linux internals looking for optimisations in speed and security. My distro of choice is Funtoo <3.
<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I tend to figure out solutions when I encounter problems, but I often forget the details of my fixes afterward.<br>
To address this, I've started writing things down in personal documentation to remember how I solved issues.<br>
This habit of writing things down inspired me to begin journaling. Like a 'fun story' story things with some plot twists ðŸ˜„
