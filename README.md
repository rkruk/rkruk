Hi!
<br>
My name is Rafal and I am a junior sys/web admin.
<br><br>
For a living I do variety of things for the really cool company - mostly some junior sys administration and web administration.
<br>
I like to tinker with Linux internals looking for optimisations in speed and security. My distro of choice is Funtoo <3.
<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I always try to solve problems when I stumble on them, but very often I just forget how I did THAT fix (yeah.. I usually try to write it down somewhere). That problem created a need to write things down, which pushed me to write my personal documentations on various things... And that accidently created idea of writing journals just for myself. So yeah I write now things for myself. Like a 'story' story things with the plot and some plot twists ðŸ˜„
