### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafal and I am a web developer. I also do ocassionally Linux sys administration.<br><br>
For a living I do IT Consultancy to those in the need of help with anything web related. But what I really really like to do is ðŸ˜„ fixing broken websites and building the new ones.<br><br> 
I like to tinker with Linux internals looking for optimisations in speed and security. My distro of choice is Funtoo.<br><br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I always try to solve problems when I stumble on them, but very often I just forget how I did THAT fix (yeah.. I usually try to write it down somewhere). That problem created a need to write things down, which pushed me to write my personal documentations on various things... And that accidently created idea of writing journals just for myself. So yeah I write now things for myself. Like a 'story' story things with the plot and some plot twists ðŸ˜„.
