Hello, Stranger â˜•<br>
My name is Rafal. I keep websites alive, more or less, and I ask myself daily why anything at all works.<br>
<br>
ðŸ”§ Professionally speaking:<br>
I wrangle servers, patch problems, and optimize Linux systems like a sculptor chiseling at marble â€” except the marble has opinions, and the tools break halfway through. Gentoo is my sanctuary, where the illusion of control feels almost real.<br>
<br>
ðŸ“œ On memory and madness:<br>
I solve problems, but the details slip away like steam from a coffee cup. So, I write it all down â€” practical notes for survival, scattered with the occasional absurdity. A habit born of necessity, now bordering on obsession.<br>
<br>
ðŸŒŒ When the sun sets:<br>
The hours blur into the soft hum of jazz and the rustle of autumn leaves. I write. Stories emerge â€” fragmented, yearning, a little unhinged. They're for the sleepless, the seekers of something more, the ones who stare into the void and smirk.<br>
<br>
âš¡ Fun fact:<br>
Every error is a riddle. Every fix, a fleeting triumph. And sometimes, late at night, I suspect the machines laugh at me.<br>
<br>
Pull up a terminal. Letâ€™s see where this goes.<br>
