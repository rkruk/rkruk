Hello, Stranger ☕  <br>
My name is Rafal, and I navigate the curious, crumbling architecture of the web. Websites breathe, servers hum their strange songs, and Linux systems evolve in ways that are both fascinating and maddening. Every day, I ask the same question: *Why does any of this even work?* And every day, the machines answer in riddles.<br>  
<br>
Professionally, where the wires hum:<br>
I solve problems in the quiet chaos of the backend. Servers demand attention, websites falter, and Linux systems reveal their quirks like old books with missing pages. Gentoo is where I find a semblance of clarity — a rabbit hole where control feels just close enough to touch, even if the tools sometimes change shape in my hands.<br>
<br>
Websites are my looking glass, servers my mad tea party, and when they break (as they inevitably do), I’m there to piece them back together — functional, coherent, and (mostly) sane.<br>
<br>
On memory, madness, and the need to write:<br>
Problems slip through my fingers like sand, and solutions dissolve as soon as the sun rises. To keep the labyrinth navigable, I write it all down. My notes are part survival guide, part fever dream — the breadcrumbs I scatter through the dark forest of troubleshooting, hoping I’ll find my way back before the wolves.<br>
<br>
When the clock strikes midnight:<br>
Night is when the veil lifts. Beneath the flicker of a terminal screen, with jazz swirling like smoke and the coffee growing cold, I write. Stories emerge, tangled and strange, like something glimpsed in a dream. They’re for the sleepless wanderers, the seekers of impossible truths, the ones who wonder if the rabbit hole ever ends.<br>
<br>
Step through the screen. Bring your questions, your puzzles, your beautifully broken things. Let’s see where this rabbit hole leads.<br>
